# bot-builder-node

I'm creating this project to explore more the Bot Builder Framework for Node.js. This bot will help users to get information about Package Tracking and Estimate Costs for the Shipping Services Companies such as USPS, Fedex and UPS.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

1. You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

  After installing the Node.js you need to install the following libraries:

  * [restify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/restify) by using ```npm install restify --save```
 
  * [botbuilder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/botbuilder) by using ```npm install botbuilder --save```

2. After setting up this, install the [Bot Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-debug-emulator?view=azure-bot-service-3.0)

  * After installing the Bot Emulator just [create a new bot configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-debug-emulator?view=azure-bot-service-3.0#connect-to-a-bot-running-on-local-host) using the same port as used in the app.js

### Running

You need to run the following command to start your server:

```npm start```

And then go to your Bot Emulator and interact with the bot!
